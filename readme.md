## Swagger - OpenAPI Specification Documentation
- Swagger helps in API documentation, make api requests get, put, patch, delete. It allows requestBody input field as payload shown in form of UI using `swagger-ui-express` and `swagger-jsdoc`.
- It allows all team members to come in same page without the issue of developers working on different tech stack.
- Because user can test the API directly from frontend and understand its usage.

If you are testing it locally, then change it to local server i.e `http://localhost:3000`
